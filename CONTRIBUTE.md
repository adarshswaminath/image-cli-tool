## Note for Contributors

The image-cli-tool is designed to provide a command-line interface for common image manipulations. It focuses on features like compression, conversion, information retrieval, and rotation. The tool is meant to serve frontend engineers who frequently deal with images and need a quick, scriptable solution. As such, functionalities like cropping, resizing, and advanced editing are intentionally omitted.

Therefore, I encourage you to align your enhancements and additions with the tool's primary purpose and keep it lightweight and focused.
